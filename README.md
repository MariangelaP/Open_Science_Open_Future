# Open_Science_Open_Future
An educational resource for young scientists, to embrace and practice Open Science principles.

## Vision statement

Open science is _vital_ for reproducible, fair, and rigorous research. For its principles to thrive, we need OS practices to be shared and adopted by as many scientists as possible, from the earliest stages of their career. 
"Open Science, Open Future" aims to be an educational resource to be used online by young scientists.

The project aims at adressing two issues:
- ensure continuity in the application of the OS principles by targeting students and young scientists: the generation with the greatest potential (and time span!!) to establish OS principles as a research reality;
- reaching out, through online resources, to students and researchers in small or isolated institutions who often have only few opportunities to be trained on the OS principles. To do so, I hope to rely on a network created together by myself, my fellow scientists at Biotop, my mentor, and the OLS community.
