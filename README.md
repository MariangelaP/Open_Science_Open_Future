# Open_Science_Open_Future
An educational resource for young scientists, to embrace and practice Open Science principles.

## Vision statement

Open science is _vital_ for reproducible, fair, and rigorous research. For its principles to thrive, we need OS practices to be shared and adopted by as many scientists as possible, from the earliest stages of their career. 
"Open Science, Open Future" (OSOF) aims to be an educational resource to be used online by young scientists.

The project aims at adressing two issues:
- ensure continuity in the application of the OS principles by targeting students and young scientists: the generation with the greatest potential (and time span!!) to establish OS principles as a research reality;
- reaching out, through online resources, to students and researchers in small or isolated institutions who often have only few opportunities to be trained on the OS principles. To do so, I hope to rely on a network created together by myself, my mentor, and the OLS community.

## is OSOF for you?

- Have you just started your career as a STEM student? Are you having troubles with your assignements because you can't access research articles? With the OSOF workshops and offline material, you can learn why promoting open-access publications is vital for science to thrive, and become an open-science ambassador within your local scientific community. 
- Are you a STEM graduate student? Do you find yourself overwhelmed by the number of experimental protocols to use and share, the jungle of programming scripts you wrote and lost in your PC, the GB of data you must store and share with your collaborators? OSOF may help you by introducing you to the latest developed freely-available resources to manage your research life.
- Are you a STEM PhD student and would like to know more about the open science resources in your field? Jump in one of our online workshops or check out the offline material. Do you know it all already, and feel like contributing to OSOF yourself? Drop us a line at openscienceopenfuture@gmail.com! Tell us more about your subject, your skills, and your ideas. At OSOF, everyone can create their own subject-specific workshops and drive the change toward open science!
- Are you a high school student or teacher? Are yu passionate about science? Find out more about the "OSOF goes to school workshops" here, drop us an email at openscienceopenfuture@gmail.com, and tell your school about OSOF!
