 ### The principles we believe in and expect you to follow
 - **Participate:** proactively take part to the conversation and encourage others to do the same by leaving them space and time to express their opinions
 - **Be respectful:** a community is such because it includes a range of personalities and opinion. We all disagree with others at times, and experience frustrations in our interactions with our collaborators. This is not a reson for being unpolite. Before speaking up, please take a moment or two to reflect on what you think and turn it into a constructive reaction. Making people feel unwelcome and insicure is counterproductive for both yourself and the group you are part of.
 - **Choose your language carefully:** Harrassing language is not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to: Violent language directed one person or a group, discriminatory jokes and language, especially when based on gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic background, religion, culture, ethnicity. Sexually explicit or violent words, Posting (or threatening to post) people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”). Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
